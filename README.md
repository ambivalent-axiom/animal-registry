Using Laravel 11 and React create:

Basic Auth: only logged in users are able to manage entities

CRUD functionality for: Farms and Farm Animals. 

Each user can create Farms and add Animals to each Farm. 

Each user can access only their farms and animals data

Farms table structure: Name (required), email, website (optional)

Animals table structure: Animal Number (required), Type name (required), years (optional)

Use migrations to create schemas

Use database seeds to create two users who each has two farms with some animals in each farm

Validate form data in both frontend and backend. Allow only 3 animals for each farm.

Use pagination for showing Farms/Animals list, 10 entries per page

Use resource controllers with default methods - index, create, store etc.

Use tailwind

Use Typescript

Use Docker to run project locally

Use automated testing (edited)
